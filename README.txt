What it is/does:

Tired of having a boring server? Want to add some mob-killing fun? Well then this is the plugin for you easy going owners, admins, and/or moderators! The ZombieApocalypse plugin (equiped with our custom map or your own) will allow server owners to create rounds/waves of random and/or even specific mobs to spawn, and give players a challenge. Although there is an added feature that can be configured within the config to turn off round-mode and activate survival-mode. Which will set any players that spawn with very few supplies, will set them into a world where survival is extremely hard, and will set the players into a Minecraft-realistic apocalypse. How long can you last in the land of the living dead?
